# Easy wins in React

## StrictMode

[Doc](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode)

Wraps your app to detect potential problems during development. Highlights unsafe lifecycles, deprecated APIs, and unexpected side effects.

```jsx
<StrictMode>
  <App />
</StrictMode>
```

## Suspense

[Doc](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)

Displays fallback UI while components load. Essential for [lazy loading](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) and data fetching.

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <SomeComponent />
</Suspense>
```

## ErrorBoundary

[Doc](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary)

Catches rendering errors and displays a fallback UI. Prevents entire app crashes from component errors.

## Portals

[Doc](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal)

Renders children into a DOM node outside the component hierarchy. Useful for modals, tooltips, and overlays.

```jsx
createPortal(children, document.body);
```

## useEffect vs useLayoutEffect

- **useEffect**: Runs after paint, non-blocking
- **useLayoutEffect**: Runs synchronously before paint, blocks visual updates

Use `useLayoutEffect` when you need to measure DOM or prevent visual flicker.
